## Subject

Compare WebSocket, Server-Sent Events (SSE), and WebTransport for real-time communication in web applications as of 2026.

## Focus Areas

- Browser support and compatibility across major browsers
- Performance characteristics: latency, throughput, connection overhead
- How each protocol handles reconnection and reliability
- Practical use cases where one clearly wins over the others

## What I Want to Learn

I'm building a collaborative document editor and need to choose a real-time transport. The app needs to support ~500 concurrent users per document with low-latency updates. I want to understand which protocol best fits this use case and why.

## Constraints

- Only consider protocols with broad production readiness (not experimental/draft specs)
- Focus on server implementations available in TypeScript/Bun/Node.js ecosystems
- Ignore mobile-native; this is browser-only
