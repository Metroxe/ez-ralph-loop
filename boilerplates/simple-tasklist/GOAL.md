# Project Goal

## Project Name

TaskFlow - Team Project Management Tool

## What We're Building

A lightweight project management web application that helps small teams track tasks, collaborate on projects, and visualize progress. The tool focuses on simplicity and speed over feature bloat.

## Problem We're Solving

Small teams (3-10 people) find existing project management tools either too complex (Jira) or too basic (shared spreadsheets). They need something that's quick to set up, easy to learn, and provides just enough structure without overwhelming users with features they don't need.

## Key Features

- Task creation and assignment with due dates
- Project boards with customizable columns (backlog, in progress, done, etc.)
- Real-time collaboration and updates
- Simple reporting (burndown charts, task completion rates)
- Email notifications for task assignments and updates

## Target Users

Small software development teams, design agencies, and startup teams who need basic project tracking without enterprise complexity.

## Success Criteria

- Team can start using it within 5 minutes of signup
- Task updates reflect in real-time for all team members
- Users report it's faster than their previous tool
- Core features work reliably without bugs
